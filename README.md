<h4>Description:</h4>
A panel with all the Find / Replace and FindInFiles functionality integrated together with smooth easy operation.
With the ability to perform wide searches, focus and filter, selective replace (Replace only in selection, 
or by rule or by choosing), perform operation on search results (bookmark, delete, send to result panel) and more...

<h4>Search and Find:</h4>
The basic Find option is simple: Just write as usual in the Scintilla editor, and the plugin will search for the word you've typed.
All the results are listed in the list box. The is an option to search all opened files, or just the current one.
Some of the results are bold, this is a feature that helps you focus on what you search. You can make bold the results that are inside the selected region or results that matches a filter.
For example, after you search for "var", make bold all the results that have the word "static".
Press on the Folder tab to search inside all the files in a specific folder. All class paths are available to choose from.

<h4>Replace:</h4>
After selecting "replace" tab, the list will become with checkboxes. All the bold entries from above are now checked. Actually, only checked result will be replaced. Making a selection range in the editor will change the selection, typing a filter will change it and even checking entries one by one can be done.

The replace also works after searching all the files in a folder, only then (for safty reasons) the operation opens all the files in the results list and make the search again, then you can replace saftly.

<h4>Grouping and Filters</h4>
Added in the 3rd release of the plugin, an option to group all the results according to the files. If you search multiple files it is a huge advantage to know what you are looking at.
In the screenshot you can see the Filter tab opened and a word written in it. This will highlight and check all the results that contains that word, so you can replace or delete only filtered results. After a filter had been applied, you can manually add or remove check marks of results.
